## Redesign for AO3
_The Organization for Transformative Works (OTW) is a nonprofit organization, established by fans in 2007, to serve the interests of fans by providing access to and preserving the history of fanworks and fan culture in its myriad forms. We believe that fanworks are transformative and that transformative works are legitimate._

I want to propose a new layout but keep clean and simple, I've saw a few comments about how the mobile is bad so I'll focus on this.

What I did?
- Create a grid
- Top bar disapear on scroll but it backs when scroll up
- Mobile menu (I am really proud of this, I know isn't big deal)
- Change on input focus
- Menu hover on desktop
- User profile on hover (on text)
- CSS animation on click on kudos (and bookmark) and subscribe
- Toggle on text info
- Share and Download toggle
- Hide creators style: remove italic and bold from text
- Font size on text
